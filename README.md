# _Wikipedia Rebuild_

#### _Replicating UI Exercise for Epicodus, 01.10.2020_

#### By _**Tiffany Siu and Neha Doodi**_

## Description

This site was an exercise in practicing using CSS bootstrap and HTML to recreate the front page of wikipedia.  It does not have any working links or functionality, it is just a visual copy of the site as it looked like on the day of creation.  It uses the different divs, spans, floats, and other layout and formatting tools available in bootstrap to style the page to be as close to the real site as possible with our current skills.
